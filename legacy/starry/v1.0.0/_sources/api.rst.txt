The starry Python API
=====================

There are two primary ways to interface with the code:
**(1)** via the :doc:`Map <MapFactory>` class factory, which allows users to
quickly instantiate surface maps described by spherical harmonics, and
**(2)** via the :doc:`Keplerian <Kepler>` module, which allows users to model
systems of objects, each with their own surface map.
