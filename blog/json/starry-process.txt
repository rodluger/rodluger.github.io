            "about": "I'm a Flatiron Fellow at the CCA in New York City, working on a variety of things related to exoplanets, stars, and astronomical data analysis. I'm interested in systematics de-trending, the search for and characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets, and the mapping of stellar and exoplanetary surfaces from photometric and spectroscopic datasets. Outside the office I love to hike, bike, swim, craft lattes, faulty parallelism, and oxford commas."

        "summary": "As many authors have shown, the information content of stellar light curves can be exceptionally tiny, owing to the large number of degeneracies when projecting from a two-dimensional space (the stellar surface) to a one-dimensional curve (the flux timeseries). Instead of trying to produce a definitive map of a stellar surface from a light curve, we can instead model the surface as a statistical process. In this post, I discuss ongoing work to develop a Gaussian process for stellar light curves whose hyperparameters are rooted in statistical properties of the stellar surface.",
