        "summary": "In this post I dig a little deeper into the assumptions I'm making when I try to model stellar surfaces (and, equivalently, stellar light curves) using a Gaussian Process. The true likelihood function for the data is certainly not a gaussian, but it turns out that approximating it as such is not a terrible idea. Here I'll discuss the concept of a synthetic likelihood, which is a term from the ecology literature (and is probably called different things in different fields), and explore its behavior with a very simple toy model. I'll warn you right now that I'm in a bit over my head with this, so comments / thoughts from proper statisticians are most welcome!",

            "Thanks to its applications in the machine learning community, <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00670'>variational inference (VI)</a> is now a popular method to approximate posterior distributions when the true density is difficult to compute. Rather than compute the posterior by sampling (such as in Markov Chain Monte Carlo), VI approximates the posterior via optimization. In the simplest variant of the method, one assumes the posterior distribution can be approximated by a (multivariate) gaussian and runs VI to find the mean(s) and variance(s) of the gaussian that best matches the true posterior. This is typically done by minimizing the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence'>K-L divergence</a> between the two distributions. VI can be an excellent choice for otherwise intractable problems, but it does have drawbacks: in its vanilla form it is unable to capture multi-modality and can underestimate the posterior variance in the presence of correlated parameters.",
            "In my research on <a href='https://luger.dev/starry.html'>modeling stellar light curve variability</a> the posterior distributions I'm interested in are often very intractable. Not because they're inherently difficult to sample from, but because my <span style='font-style:italic;'>likelihood function</span> is so difficult to compute. Briefly, I'm interested in inferring star spot properties, such as their typical sizes and latitudes, from stellar light curves. This is a notoriously ill-posed problem (<a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...901...14B/abstract'>Basri et al. 2020</a> is a nice review), as there are perfect degeneracies at play that can lead to an infinite number of equally likely surface map solutions for a given light curve. As I described in <a href='https://luger.dev/blog/2020-10-01.html'>previous blog posts</a>, one trick is to accept that we cannot know <span style='font-style:italic;'>exactly</span> what any stellar surface looks like and instead directly solve for the <span style='font-style:italic;'>statistics</span> we care about: the distribution of star spot sizes and latitudes, irrespective of how big any individual spot is or where it is on the star. This works even better if we have an ensemble of light curves of \"similar\" stars: we can use their collective information to better constrain the statistics of star spots across all members of the ensemble.",
            "This is all well and good until we think about the integrals we need to compute along the way. What I described above was the process of <span style='font-style:italic;'>marginalizing</span> over the nuisance parameters (the nitty gritty details of individual spots) to compute the <span style='font-style:italic;'>marginal likelihood</span> that a given star (or a given ensemble of stars) is a draw from a particular distribution of star spot sizes and latitudes.",
            "Say we have some set of parameters $\\theta$ controlling the spot distributions (say, the mean and variance of the spot size distribution, the mean and variance of the spot latitude distribution, etc.) The marginal likelihood is the probability of our data $y$ given $\\theta$, which can be computed by integrating over all the nuisance parameters $c_0 \\, \\cdots \\, c_n$:",

            "Computing this is a tall order, especially since $n$ can be quite large (hundreds or even thousands in my problems). Instead of attempting to solve this integral exactly, the approach I took was to assume that my marginal likelihood can be well approximated by a multidimensional gaussian (see <a href='https://luger.dev/blog/2020-09-24.html'>this blog post</a>). The task then is to find how its mean $\\mu(\\theta)$ and the covariance $\\Sigma(\\theta)$ depend on the parameters I care about, $\\theta$.",

Here, however, I am computing the variational distribution for the <span style='font-style:italic;'>likelihood</span>, not the posterior. So this isn't really VI at all! I spent a while poking around online to figure out <span style='font-style:italic;'>what</span> exactly the name for what I was doing was, and I found several papers in ecology doing similar things. They all date back to <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09319'>this paper by Wood (2010)</a>, who developed an approach he dubbed the <span style='font-style:italic;'>synthetic likelihood</span>.",

            "The idea is fairly straightforward. The data consists of measurements of the size of an insect population over time, and the ecologist's task is to infer some fundamental parameter of the population that controls its growth rate. The problem is that the process generating the data is extremely chaotic; the population undergoes sudden, fast, and unpredictable jumps and declines in size due to various random environmental pressures. Thus, basic aspects of the dataset such as the particular times at which these spikes occur are mostly random and thus unrelated to the true parameters we care about. However, statistics of the dataset (such as, perhaps, the frequency of spikes, their relative amplitudes, the details of the shape of the spikes, etc.) <span style='font-style:italic;'>are</span> informative.",

Panels <span style='font-weight:600;'>b</span> and <span style='font-weight:600;'>c</span> are the log likelihood as a function of a noise parameter $e_1$ and the growth rate parameter $r$, conditioned on the true values of $r$ and $e_1$, respectively. In addition to being difficult to compute, this likelihood is extremely noisy. Panel <span style='font-weight:600;'>d</span> is the (marginal) log synthetic likelihood, which is much smoother and peaks close to the true value $\\log r = 3.8$."
            },
            "The thing to do is therefore compute the likelihood marginalized over the phase of the spikes: that is, integrating over all of the (infinite number of) ways in which a population with a given intrinsic growth rate $r$ can evolve under a chaotic noise process. This is the same intractable integral as in the star spot mapping problem! In Wood's case, he needs to marginalize over the phases of the population spikes; in my case, I need to marginalize over the phases of the spots (among other things).",
            "Wood's approach to computing this intractable integral is to bypass it by sampling. Chaotic systems are easy enough to <span style='font-style:italic;'>forward</span> model: pick a value of $r$, pick some parameters of the noise process, set your initial conditions, and diff-eq away. For a fixed value of $r$, we can generate lots (say, hundreds of thousands) of synthetic datasets. Each one will have spikes in different places and look different overall, but they will all be draws from the exact same statistical process. The trick then is to compute the empirical mean and (dense) covariance matrix from this simulated dataset, compute the likelihood of the corresponding gaussian, and call it a day. He dubs this likelihood function the <span style='font-style:italic;'>synthetic likelihood</span>.",
            "Wood goes on to show just how powerful this approximate inference technique is in modeling chaotic ecological systems (see <a href='#Figure3'>Figure 3</a>, for instance). As he argues in the paper, it ends up being a pretty good, <span style='font-style:italic;'>asymptotically unbiased</span> technique for doing inference. Most of the statistics in the paper are devoted to figuring out just how small a synthetic sample he can get away with and still get good results with this estimator (large samples take time to generate; small samples lead to noisy means and covariances and biased results).",
            "If you read my <a href='https://luger.dev/blog/2020-10-01.html'>last blog post</a>, you'll realize I'm doing the exact same thing, except that I know how to compute the mean and covariance <span style='font-style:italic;'>analytically</span>. No need to do any sampling! This is thanks to just how well-behaved spherical harmonics (and, in particular, their rotation matrices) are. Given a value of the spot distribution parameters $\\theta$, I can compute the mean $\\mu(\\theta)$ and full covariance $\\Sigma(\\theta)$ describing the stellar light curves in <span style='font-style:italic;'>a few hundredths of a second</span>.",
            "This sounds awesome (and it is!) but lately I've been thinking a lot about what the downsides of this approximation really are. If you compare Figures <a href='#Figure1'>1</a> and <a href='#Figure2'>2</a> (samples from the true distribution and samples from the gaussian approximation, respectively), you'll see that they are <span style='font-style:italic;'>similar</span>, but certainly not the same. If I showed you a random sample from one of those distributions, you'd probably have no trouble identifying whether it came from the true distribution or from the approximation. In particular, the gaussian approximation is smoother (since, after all, it's a GP!) and has some bright spots in addition to dark spots. At some level, this <span style='font-style:italic;'>has</span> to affect my posterior inference &mdash; I just wasn't sure how!",
