            "about": "I'm a Flatiron Fellow at the CCA in New York City, working on a variety of things related to exoplanets, stars, and astronomical data analysis. I'm interested in systematics de-trending, the search for and characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets, and the mapping of stellar and exoplanetary surfaces from photometric and spectroscopic datasets. Outside the office I love to hike, bike, swim, craft lattes, faulty parallelism, and Oxford commas."

            "Below is the talk I gave at the CCA on November 5. It touches on many of the same things I covered in the previous two posts in this series (<a href='2020-09-24.html'>here</a> and <a href='2020-10-01.html'>here</a>). I've actually made quite a bit more progress on the problem since I gave that talk, so if you're interested, check out the (nearly complete) draft of the paper <a href='https://github.com/rodluger/starry_process/raw/master-pdf/tex/ms.pdf'>here</a>. The code, <code>starry_process</code>, is also nearly production-ready. You can install it from source <a href='https://github.com/rodluger/starry_process'>here</a>. I'm still working on the <a href='https://luger.dev/starry_process'>documentation</a>, but the API and a couple examples are ready to go.<br><br>",
