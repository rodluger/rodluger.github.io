I'm interested in systematics de-trending, the search for and characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets, and the mapping of stellar and exoplanetary surfaces from photometric and spectroscopic datasets. Outside the office I love to hike, bike, swim, craft lattes, faulty parallelism, and Oxford commas."

The kernel of the Gaussian process is a function of six hyperparameters that control the mean and standard deviation of the spot size, latitude, and contrast distributions (top panels). The bottom panels show random samples from the GP on the surface of the star (in a Mollweide projection) and in flux space. Line colors correspond to different stellar inclinations with respect to the line of sight. Because the kernel is an analytic function of the hyperparameters, drawing samples and computing marginal likelihoods with a <a href='https://github.com/rodluger/starry_process'>starry process</a> is extremely fast.",

Below the distribution are five random samples from the GP, visualized on the surface of the star in an equal-area Mollweide projection. Below each are the corresponding light curves assuming different viewing inclinations ranging from 15&deg; (yellow) to 90&deg (dark red).

I mentioned in the <a href='2020-09-24.html'>previous post</a> that an interpretable GP can be used within a hierarchical model to learn about ensemble statistics of many light curves. To recap, the idea behind this is that any individual light curve contains only a small fraction of the information about what the surface of the star looks like (because of all the degeneracies that come with projecting a two-dimensional surface down to a one-dimensional flux timeseries). However, these degeneracies are inclination-dependent, so different stars will have different degeneracies. The trick is to realize that if we collect light curves of many <span style='font-style:italic;'>similar</span> stars, we can learn more about the population than we can for any individual star. Here, <span style='font-style:italic;'>similar</span> is loosely defined: we simply want stars whose properties are drawn from the same parent distribution (individual stars may still look quite different!) To show how we can do this using a <span style='font-style:italic;'>starry process</span>, let's create a toy dataset:",

The surface maps were generated by placing 20 discrete circular spots at latitudes and with sizes and contrasts drawn from fiducial Gaussian distributions. The light curves were then computed by expanding the surface in spherical harmonics to high degree (30) and using <a href='https://github.com/rodluger/starry'>starry</a> to compute fluxes. Each star was given a random inclination drawn from a \\(\\sin i\\) prior; the \\( \\times \\) on each map marks the sub-observer point. Finally, a small amount of noise was added to each light curve to simulate photon noise.",

            "The figure above shows a dataset comprised of ten light curves of stars with statistically similar star spot properties. I generated it by choosing fiducial values for the mean and variance of the (Gaussian) distributions for the spot size, latitude, and contrast, then drawing 20 spots from these distributions for each star. The spots are circular and the contrast is uniform within each one (as we will see below, this is quite different from the prescription used to compute the GP; this is extremely important, since we don't want our proof that the GP works to be circular!) I then gave each star a random inclination, drawn from the expected \\(\\sin i\\) prior for inclination angles, and computed the \"observed\" light curve using <a href='https://github.com/rodluger/starry'>starry</a>.",
            "Now, we pretend we merely observe these light curves, and that we have absolutely no knowledge of the number of spots, the spot sizes, positions, and contrasts, or the inclination of any of the stars. (For simplicity, we'll assume we know the rotational period exactly, although this could easily be sampled over as well). The only thing we'll assume is that these stars are \"similar\": that is, there is some parent distribution from which all these stellar surfaces were drawn. In practice, this might mean the stars have the same spectral type, similar ages (or rotation periods), and similar metallicities. What we therefore do is to place uninformative priors on all of these quantities and use the sampler of our choice to explore their posteriors. Our likelihood function is the usual GP likelihood (see <a href='2020-09-24.html#GPLikelihood'>this equation</a>), although this time our GP kernel is an explicit function of the parameters we care about. <a href='#Figure3'>Figure 3</a> below shows the posterior distributions for some of the quantities of interest from a Variational Inference (VI) scheme:",
