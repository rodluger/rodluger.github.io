                         <p>
                              Thanks to missions like <span style="font-style:italic;">Kepler</span> and
                              <span style="font-style:italic;">TESS</span>, we now have access to hundreds of
                              thousands of light curves of stars. Many of these light curves are variable, often
                              due to star spots, faculae, and other surface features that rotate into and out of
                              view over the course of a stellar rotation. Even though these stars are unresolved
                              &mdash; all we get is a one-dimensional flux timeseries &mdash; we can in principle
                              use their light curves to learn about what their surfaces look like: how many spots
                              does a given star have, how dark are they, and where on the surface do they typically
                              appear? While interesting in their own right, these questions can address fundamental
                              physical properties of a star, in particular the nature and topology of its magnetic field
                              and convective processes in its interior.
                         </p>

                         <p>
                              But <span style="font-style:italic;">how</span> exactly can we use a light curve to learn
                              about the stellar surface? It turns out this is an extremely difficult problem because of
                              the degeneracies involved. While a given configuration of spots on the surface of a star
                              has a unique light curve (e.g., at a given inclination and in a given bandpass), the same
                              is not true for the converse: a given light curve does <span
                                   style="font-style:italic;">not</span>
                              correspond to a unique stellar surfaces. In fact, for any light curve, we can find an
                              infinite number of solutions to the mapping problem that fit the data <span
                                   style="font-style:italic;">exactly</span>. To put it another way, if we are given a
                              stellar light curve (and no other prior information), it is <span
                                   style="font-style:italic;">provably impossible</span> to
                              determine
                              the shape, size, location, contrast, and number of spots on its surface.
                         </p>

                         <p>
                              So how do we get around this? The trick is to abandon the notion of trying to image
                              <span style="font-style:italic;">individual</span> stars. (If we have very strong priors,
                              or if we're lucky enough to see the star being occulted by a companion, the mapping
                              problem
                              suddenly becomes a lot more tractable; but let's set this point aside for now.)
                              While light curves of individual stars contain only a very small amount of information
                              about
                              their surfaces, the light curves of lots of stars together constrain a lot more about the
                              distribution of stellar surfaces across the population.
                              I talk through this point in a couple posts in my blog (<a
                                   href="blog/2020-09-24.html">Interpretable GPs I</a> and <a
                                   href="blog/2020-10-01.html">Interpretable GPs II</a>), so make sure to check those
                              out
                              if you're interested.
                         </p>

                         <p>
                              Simultaneously analyzing lots of light curves can be extremely computationally expensive,
                              since we typically want our population size to be large (e.g., hundreds of stars). Since
                              we need
                              to jointly fit for the surface parameters of each star, the number of parameters in our
                              model can quickly
                              become intractable (thousands to tens of thousands), making posterior inference quite
                              tricky. One workaround is to use a <a
                                   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_process">Gaussian process</a> (GP),
                              which
                              makes it extremely easy to compute marginal likelihoods: i.e., the likelihood that a
                              star has spots concentrated at a certain latitude, marginalized (integrated) over all
                              possible ways you can arrange the spots. But in order to do that, we need to first come
                              up with a Gaussian process for stellar light curves: that is, one which is an explicit
                              function of parameters we care about, such as the mean spot latitude, the mean spot size,
                              etc.
                         </p>

                         <p>
                              That's the idea behind a <span style="font-style:italic;">starry process</span>. It's an
                              adaptation of my <a href="starry-about.html">starry</a> mapping code into a statistical
                              process
                              that makes it easy to ask questions about ensembles of light curves. Given lots of light
                              curves
                              of "similar" stars, a <span style="font-style:italic;">starry process</span> makes it
                              easier
                              to ask questions such as, "Do M dwarfs have polar or equatorial spots?" or
                              "Do all G dwarfs have spots as small as those on the Sun"?
                         </p>

                         <p>
                              This is very much still a work in progress, and I'm actively working on both the

                                        hyperparameters that control the mean and standard deviation of the spot size,
